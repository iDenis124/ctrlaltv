# Control Alt V

## About <a name = "about"></a>

We've all encountered all those annoying text fields in which we could not copy paste stuff.  
This is a fix to that problem, by making it look like you're typing whatever is in your clipboard.

### Building yourself

Idk why you would want to, but you need [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed, then use `AHK2EXE`

### Installing

Run the setup in the [releases](https://github.com/iDenis124/ctrlaltv/releases) tab

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To activate it, use
```
Control + Alt + V
```
It will paste whatever text you have in your clipboard.
